//     (lazy resolve during hit tests) or by `commit()` (at paint time).
//     Cleared by `invalidate()` on scroll, doc transitions, and prop changes.
//   - `renderedLayout` — what's currently painted on the canvas. Updated
//     only by `commit()`, so reactive consumers stay locked to the painted
//     frame and don't see pre-paint geometry from hit-test recomputes.
//
// `commit()` is the moment `latestLayout` becomes `renderedLayout` and
// listeners fire. Hot pointer paths skip the commit and read `latest`
// directly via `get()`; only the render path commits.
