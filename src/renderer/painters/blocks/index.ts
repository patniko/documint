// Re-exports for the orchestrator. The blocks family splits into two files:
//   - backgrounds.ts — per-line block backgrounds (code fence fill, table cell
//                      chrome dispatch) and per-line active-block tint
//   - rules.ts       — block-level rules: heading underline, blockquote bar,
//                      and divider
//
// The orchestrator imports from this barrel; nothing else outside the blocks
// family should need direct file imports.
